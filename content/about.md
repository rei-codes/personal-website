## My Mobile Development Journey

- **Android (6 Months)**
  
  I worked about like 6 months at University out of curiosity. Because of my first experience I only learned the basic concepts like Git, Material Design, OOP, Networking (REST), Lifecycles, Intents, Fragments, Bindings.. . but also Kotlin ofc!

- **React Native (6 Months)**
  
  While working Android, I saw RN and I fall in love the "cross platform" concept and I started to learn RN. but first I needed to learn JavaScript, ES6, React then React Native! Anyway, RN was perfect at first, because It was much easier from Android and can also build for iOS even you can make Web apps! What a dream! But shortly after, While using RN I realized the bitter truth. RN was good on paper but in reality.. . If you want to try to make something, you're gonna definitely struggle with a lot of bugs and overdated packages, also performance problems are the plus! 

- **Flutter (3+ Years)**
   
   Lastly, while searching performance problems for RN, I've found Flutter but I hesitated because It wasn't mature yet. But when I take a look at that, I fall in love with it and stick with it over 3 years!

   I think Flutter is the future, that's why I'm constantly improving myself at Flutter and Software Engineering and go beyond!

<br>

**What I do not prefer in Flutter**
- State Management
  - [GetX](https://pub.dev/packages/get) - [for some good reasons](https://twitter.com/filiphracek/status/1468565501701939203?lang=en)
  - [mobx](https://pub.dev/packages/mobx), [redux](https://pub.dev/packages/redux) - They are great Global SM solutions but I don't think they are good fit for Flutter
- Local Storage - [sqflite](https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite),.. and any other [sql packages](https://fluttergems.dev/sql-database/) - There is no specific reason, I just don't like sql much ^^" 
- HTTP Client - [http](https://pub.dev/packages/http) - It's so primitive beside [dio](https://pub.dev/packages/dio)
- Testing - [mockito](https://pub.dev/packages/mockito) - It needs code generation and type safety problems etc.

<br>

## Little Note!
- I use GitLab for private projects
- I use GitHub for public / open-source projects
- I also used BitBucket for a while (at ICE Company), I don't know why people use it. (It's )


That's why my GitHub Activity seems a bif off.

Anyway! I just wanted to say that, It's not matter much!
